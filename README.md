# bluecougar_x_ros
A ROS C++ wrapper for Matrix Vision GigE vision camera, mvBlueCOUGAR-X series.
I tested it with ROS KINETIC + linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. A tested camera model is exactly mvBlueCOUGAR-X-104iG.

## Feature
I construct this code for 'hardware sync. by external trigger signal'. This node supports hardware trigger mode.

## Pre-requisite
Before using, camera driver (mvGenI) need to be installed. It can be found at the manufacturer site. (Matrix Vision).
